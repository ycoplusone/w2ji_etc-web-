# Music-mini-game
Small game design to help beginner music students how to read the notes on a musical staff using JavaScript and SVG graphics. 
In the game a random note will appear on the staff and the students has to name that note, the game keeps score of every correct answer,
in case the students answers incorrectly a message appears with the correct answer. The students has to input an answer or else the game
wont continue (no skipping), the buttons will buttons will be enabled and disabled to avoid cheating. Keyboard input is supported, and I 
am thinking about adding piano sound to each note when it appears.
